		<section name="The Hibernate Spatial Oracle Provider">
			<p>
				The Oracle Provider adds support for Oracle Spatial to
				Hibernate Spatial. It has been tested with Oracle 10i,
				but it should work equally well with Oracle 9i and
				Oracle 11g.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Provider makes use of the proprietary Oracle SDO
				Java API.
