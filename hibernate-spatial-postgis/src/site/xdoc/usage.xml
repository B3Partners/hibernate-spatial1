        <section name="Hibernate Spatial Postgis Provider Usage">
            <p>
                To have Hibernate Spatial use this provider, simply drop
                the jar on the class-path alongside the
                hibernate-spatial.jar. When the Hibernate Spatial
                library is loaded it will find the provider and use it
                to retrieve the Hibernate dialect for Postgresql with
                the Postgis extension. This dialect is a subclass of
                <code>org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                With the provider installed, you can use it by setting
                the dialect in the Hibernate configuration file as in
                the following snippet.
            </p>
            <source>
                ...
                &lt;property name="hibernate.dialect"&gt;
                org.hibernatespatial.postgis.PostgisDialect
                &lt;/property&gt;
                ...
            </source>

            <p>
                When there is more than one Hibernate Spatial provider
                on the Class-Path, you should explicitly label the
                dialect for the Geometry valued properties.
            </p>
            <source>
                ...
                &lt;property name="geometry"&gt;
                &lt;type name="org.hibernatespatial.GeometryUserType"&gt;
                &lt;param name="dialect"&gt;postgis&lt;/param&gt;
                &lt;/type&gt;
                &lt;column name="geom" /&gt;
                &lt;/property&gt;
                ...
            </source>
        </section>
