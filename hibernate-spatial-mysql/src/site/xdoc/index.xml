		<section name="The Hibernate Spatial MySQL Provider">
			<p>
				The MySQL Provider adds support for MySQL to
				Hibernate Spatial. It has been tested with MySQL 5.0
				and should work with any version later than that.
			</p>

            <p>This provider provides two dialects for MySQL. The <code>MySQLSpatialDialect</code> and the
                <code>MySQLSpatialInnoDBDialect</code>. They extend their respective non-spatial Hibernate
            dialects
            </p>

			<p>
				Note that MySQL does not completely implement the OGC Simple Feature Specification. 
				Some functions that work for PostGIS or Oracle may fail to work for MySQL.
