		<section name="The Hibernate Spatial MySQL Provider">
			<p>
				The MySQL Provider adds support for MySQL to
				Hibernate Spatial. It has been tested with MySQL 5.0
				and should work with any version later than that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that MySQL does not completely implement the OGC Simple Feature Specification. 
				Some functions that work for PostGIS or Oracle may fail to work for MySQL.
